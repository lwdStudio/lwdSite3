# lwdSite 3
This is my third generation personal website. Use JAMStack, build with Gatsby and Strapi.

## Technologies
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Gatsby 4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as the front-end of the site. Learn more in the [```/web```](/web) folder
- [TailwindCSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework.
- [Strapi 3](http://strapi.io/), an open source content management system (CMS) as the back-end of the site. Learn more in the [```/api```](/api) folder

## Notice
JAMStack separates the front-end and back-end, so you need to build ```api``` and ```web``` separately as well.

I use yarn as my node package manager of choice. checkout [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)'s website to learn how to install yarn on your system. 

Both front-end and back-end have something to configure before build. Ensure you have configured it before moving on to production.

You may need to fill in some content in Strapi first before developing/using the strapi front-end.

## Get started
Clone this repo onto your system.

First configure Strapi, check out README file in [```/api```](/api) to learn how to do it.

Then configure Gatsby, check out README file in [```/web```](/web) to learn how to do it.
