# lwdSite 3
The third generation of my personal website. 

# Technologies
- NodeJS
- Yarn
- Gatsby 3 as the front-end of the site. Learn more when you view ```/web``` folder
- Strapi, an open source content management system (CMS) as the back-end of the site. Learn more when you view ```/api``` folder

# Notice
You have to set up front-end and back-end seperately

I use yarn 1 as npm package manager. checkout [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)'s website to learn how to install yarn on your system. 

Both front-end and back-end has environment variable or ```.env``` file. Ensure you have configure it before move on to production.

You may need to fill in some content in Strapi first before developing/using front-end.
