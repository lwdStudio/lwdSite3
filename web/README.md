-  ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS for page styling.
-  ‚úÖ Responsive layout.
-  ‚úÖ Dark mode support - via Tailwild CSS media
-  ‚úÖ External Link Icon - There is a [debate](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/28/removing-the-external-link-icon-from-gov-uk/) on this, and I will be looking into it.
-  ‚úÖ SEO and manifest information for each page.


## üìù To-Do

-  üîú Add i18n support: query, language switcher, content.
-  üîú Add dark mode switch.

## üöÄ Get Started

  ### Initial Environment
  
  While you are in this folder, initialize and install dependency using yarn:
  
  ```bash
  yarn
  ```
  
  Follow promt on your terminal if anything happens.
  
  ### Configure
  
  Before you start, configure environment variable first. 
  
  Copy or rename ```.env.example``` (I prefer copy so there will be a backup file)
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  
  # or
  
  mv .env.example .env
 ```
 
 There are two items you can modify:
 - ```GATSBY_ROOT_URL``` for your site address
 - ```GATSBY_STRAPI_API_URL``` for your Strapi backend address

For development you can configure:
```shell
GATSBY_ROOT_URL=
GATSBY_STRAPI_API_URL=http://localhost:1337
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Specify port after root domain. Your configuration might be different than mine, create your own file to reflect your actural environment.

Ensure you have configure Strapi so Gatsby can pull data from it. If you not configure GATSBY_ROOT_URL, the site will be up at ```http://localhost:8000```, or if no error occour, it will be appear on your terminal.
  
  ### Develop
  Start Gatsby development server is simple after you have configure it.
  
  Ensure you are in this folder, then
  
  ```
  yarn develop
  ```
  
  It will take some time to build your site and admin bundle. When it finish, you can access your site and Graphql as prompted.
  
  ### Production
  Before started, configure your ```.env``` file using acutural domain.
  
  There are two ways to serve your site:
  #### Using NodeJS server.
  
  If you have pm2:
  
  ```bash
  pm2 start "gatsby build && gatsby serve"
  ```
  If using gatsby command failed, install gatsby-cli tools first
  ```
  yarn global add gatsby-cli
  ```
  
  #### Serve as static file.
  First build your site
  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```
  
  Configure nginx for access
  
  At your nginx configuration file location ```/etc/nginx/sites-availabe``` create your site configuration
  
  ```nginx
  server {
    root <path to my-gatsby-app>/public;
    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
    server_name <your-domain-name>;
    location / {
      try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
  }
  ```
  When you are done, system link it to ```/etn/nginx/sites-enable```
  
  Remember to secure your website using SSL. Easiest way is to use ```certbot``` to get an Let's Encrypt certificate. Certbot should automatically install and configure it to your nginx configuration file.
  
## Issue
When trying to deploy this site on platforms like Gatsby Cloud, Cloudflare Page and any other similar services, it will have dependency issue on my ```@fontsource``` font package. Even the dependency is decleared on ```yarn.lock``` and being installed first time using ```yarn```. I had to reinstall the font again manually using ```yarn add @fontsource/noto-sans-sc``` (other fontsource font will be the same) to solve the issue.
